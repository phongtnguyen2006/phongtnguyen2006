## My Projects

### [Form Fitness]

3 friends and I created Form Fitness in 36 hours as our project for UCLA's annual Hackathon, LAHacks. It's an AI-powered, all-in-one fitness app that utilizies computer vision and machine learning to track exercise form in real-time and provide actionable feedback. Furthermore, the app can be used to track daily workouts and provide workout statistics. We used React and TypeScript on the frontend and Flask on the backend, with TensorFlow and Google MoveNet for the computer vision components.

### [Image to Song]

Image to Song is a web app that recommends music based on an image you upload. The system uses a Hugging Face vision model to extract descriptive tags from the image and then queries a chat model via Groq to generate relevant song suggestions. The frontend was built with React, and the backend uses Flask. This project focuses on combining multi-modal AI (vision and language) to generate creative, emotion-driven recommendations—all without the need for paid API tokens.

### [SIP]

SIP is a mobile app my team and I built at UCLA’s Creative Labs to help users save, review, and discover cafés. As the Developer Lead, I led a team of six developers, designing the system architecture, assigning weekly deliverables, and coordinating with project leads and UI/UX designers. The app was built with React Native, Firebase for authentication and real-time updates, and a Node.js + Express backend with MongoDB. We implemented a keyword-based search with natural language parsing and created a system to aggregate user input to display commonly mentioned features and average ratings.

### [UCSB DINE IN]

UCSB Dine-In is a full-stack web app built in 24 hours at a hackathon with 3 friends. It’s designed for UC Santa Barbara students to share dining hall food reviews, post photos, and check daily menus in real-time. I used Next.js for the front-end and Supabase for the backend and authentication, styling the app with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. We integrated UCSB’s public dining API to fetch live menu data, enabling students to make informed dining decisions and engage with a food-loving campus community.
